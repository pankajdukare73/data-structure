defination:
      1>data structure is storage that is used to store and oraganize data.
      2>we efficiently perform opertion like travesing accesing searching sorting updating on it.

 Type of data structute:
   1>premitive data stucture:
         that are build in data structure.
      type->
         1>int
         2>char
         3>float
   2>Non-premitive data structure:
         that are user define data structure.
      tyep->
         1>Linear data structure:
               in this data structure the element are store in sequential one after the other.
            type->
               1>static:
                     in this data structure size is fixed.
                  type->
                     1>Array.
               2>dynamic data structure:
                     in this data structure size is dyanamcaly change.
                  type->
                     1>Linked list.
                     2>stack.
                     3>queue.
         2>non-lenear data structure:
               1>in this data structure data element store in heirachical order.
               2>one element connected one or many element.
            type->
               1>graph data sructure.
               2>tree data strructure.
